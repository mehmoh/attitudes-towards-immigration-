#  Public attitude toward immigrants in Canada



## Topic

The initial question that I am going to answer is how public attitude toward immigration has shaped in Canada. I will identify which groups of people with different socio-demographic backgrounds are against immigration and what is the source of their opposition. There are different theories available that describe why are people against immigrants. For example, the job market competition theory says that natives are against immigrants because they compete with newcomers over resources. The Racial theory argues that natives are against immigrants simply because they see newcomers as outsiders. It is interesting to see which of these theories is able to explain attitudes towards immigrants in Canada.

## Dataset

the data that I am going to use is Canadian election Studies (CES). The CES is a governmental agency which collects Canadians' political behaviors and attitudes. In the online survey of 2019, CES asked different questions from  37,822 participants of the survey.
